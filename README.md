# chatApp
Chat app built in ionic.
Hi and welcome.
This is a chat app built using ionic. It uses firebase to enable users to message in real time.
It is essentailly one big chat room where users can login using their name and talk to others.
A message pops up when users join and leave the chat.
I hoped to get push notifcations enabled but ran out of time therefore the setting page has no functionality.
The commented out code in settings.ts is the beginning of getting push notifcations enabled.
I have download my project for github and it works. It may ask you to install project dependencies when you run ionic serve but after that it runs as it should. I have also tested it on the ionic dev app for mobile and that works as well although the message send icon appears to get coverd when the keyboard pops up on mobile. Just simply tap and the keyboard will dissapear and then you can send the message.
